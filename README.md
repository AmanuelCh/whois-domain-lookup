# Whois Domain Lookup

The site provides a simple and user-friendly interface for performing WHOIS lookups on domain names.  It fetches WHOIS information from the [API Layer](https://apilayer.com/) API and displays the results in a clear and organized manner.

## Note

I'm just using `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` to store the API key in the client-side code. This is a security risk and is absolutely NOT recommended for production use. You need to fetch the data on the server and then send the data to the client..  The client should only receive the processed data from the server. You can read the release if you wanna do it
